We already have connections with local youth clubs in these places where we can quickly proceed with our plans. As we progress we would aim to branch out internationally. We have connections in low income countries such as Indonesia and India where soccer is an important part of many children's lives. The Futbol foundation will bring the community together with love and passion for soccer. We want to gather equipment for low income kids in order to show them the beauty of soccer and teamwork. Our collaboration with local soccer clubs like Sheriff's FC and San Ramon FC will allow us to utilize their facilities to teach kids how to play soccer and will help them learn not only soccer but also the value of working together to achieve a goal. The Futbol Foundation community will be known for our caring nature and our tendency to help those who may not be able to help themselves. Finally, we want to build a passion for soccer in each and every child we come across, because we believe that the beautiful game of soccer can teach lessons about life that are invaluable to the development of children. Sheriff's FC main goal is to keep kids off the streets and to bring the community together. This goes hand in hand with what the Futbol foundation is planning to achieve. We would love to raise money through fundraisers and donations from training kids or reffing games to hopefully help support Sheriff's FC's mission to make the beautiful game more accessible to all. By raising money and providing materials, hopefully this club can continue to support many children and their love of soccer.

In our school we have developed a huge soccer community. We have multiple people that are following the game of soccer and playing it. As a club we hope to tie in our love for soccer, while also supporting others that don't have access to it. Our club teaches our members to take initiative, be organized, and to be a team player. Like soccer, a club can only function when all of the members are on the same page and are working together. Our club will teach that through fundraisers where we have to work together to set up, communicate what is happening and work together to raise funds. Our efforts to connect the school using a sport will allow those harboring a passion for soccer to come together and help others join in on the benefits that soccer provides. We will host soccer events like pick-up games and trainings to show that hard work and dedication pay off, and when working together, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to.",Wednesday During Lunch once a month

Then, we would gradually progress to simulate a court case where participants negotiate with the opposition to form a fundamental settlement on what to do with the defendant.

Marching Orchestra,Walker Marc (may change),Ethan Yang,dvmarchingorks@gmail.com,"Our mission is to spread joy and comfort through the art of the performing arts. As noted by the CDC, suicide is the second leading cause of death for young adults; in other terms, us. Given Dougherty´s competitive attitude in academics, the chance of death is high. My friend who was a senior committed suicide through Dougherty. He was energetic and above all a kind person. He couldn't see the light. Although I am filled with anger and negative emotions of losing him, the joy of my life, I learned that I can not trap myself in the past knowing that there are people who feel the same way as my friend. Given my love of performing arts and the awards I received, I feel that this club is a necessity for our community. We will accomplish this goal by holding weekly rehearsals where musicians and artists are to practice their respective instrument(s) where they are to produce awesome pieces of film and music. Below are the 2 groups and their individual goals and plans. Regarding music, we plan to create a marching band and a full orchestra. Our marching band will perform at football games.

Students Demand Action,"Colard, Sarah (Madame)",Maggie Gu,dvhs.sda@gmail.com,"With the number of gun violence incidents becoming an increasing concern, we are left to see millions of students in the US afraid and threatened by shooting incidents that simply strip them of their ability to learn freely. The fact of the matter is that we can't distance ourselves away from this pressing issue, as DVHS itself has been a target of such deplorable and alarming threats. This is exactly why we aim to partner with Students Demand Action (a national initiative) as a way to raise awareness and attempt to combat this concern. Such threats not only deprive students of the universal right to safety but also weaken school spirit as they target many marginalized groups at schools, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community and people of color. As a club, we believe that no student or person in general should ever have to feel scared about their own lives, therefore we hope to work together to facilitate healthy group discussion amongst our peers and find collaborative ways to bring forth this issue on the legislative level as well. We hope to host fundraisers, panels, and discussions throughout the year to spread awareness and hope you consider joining our club!!","Once a month, on the third Friday, in room 3211"

Ultimate Summit,"Ingram, Duane",Leo Xiao,ultimatesummitdvhs@gmail.com,"The point of Ultimate Summit is to hopefully be able to host smash tournaments here at DVHS. Last year during February, leadership had hosted a smash tournament that ended up having more active participants than the previous teacher vs. student dodgeball rally before that (not sure if this is true, Tanner Kim told me so) so I feel like running a more frequent version of that would be a fun idea. This club will also serve as a group that can bring together the lurking Smash Bros fans that we had previously never known about, since it was actually a huge surprise with last year's tournament and its turnout of people. I myself have also been noticing more people gain interest in this game throughout the years, whether it be having people walk up and play smash with me on my switch in the hallways or hearing about other smash events that other people had good experiences at, so to bring that to this school, especially without any local smash-supporting places that close around, is an experience that we hope to realize.","every week on thursday lunch, tournament the week before last week of month on wednesday after school"

Each practice/meeting can build upon concepts of the last one so that each member can develop and learn the game. These monthly plans will teach members how beach volleyball works and hopefully interest them further. We could scrimmage each other and as well as other schools in our area. We could connect with the local schools who have beach volleyball programs/clubs. For example, Monte Vista High School and Carondelet High School both currently have beach volleyball, and we can invite them to come to us. There are beach volleyball tournaments that some members may want to participate in that are hosted by organizations such as the California Beach Volleyball Association, who hosts tournaments in Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay.
